## The competitive state of the games industry
As I'm sure you're aware, the games industry is a particularly competitive one, indies get crushed by big AAA productions with incredible budgets. The problem of course is that most of the times, producing a good game/product and producing a profitable one is not always the same, and this is by no means a critique of the hard working developers in this enviornment, I know we do what we can to make the best experiences possible for our dear players... it's just that, well, we want to be able to eat too.

## A game engine, uhm, throupoly...?

And guess what, if the games market is competitive, the game engine one is even more so, we have (let's face it) two, maybe three major engines that are relevant in the industry, Unreal, Unity, and Godot is starting to pick up some more users, but it's still not being used as widely as tech twitter would have you believe. Given this information it seems futile to try and make something to even attempt to compete with them; and yet, many people still create amazing engines like Cherno's [Hazel Engine](https://hazelengine.com/) which was actually partial inspiration for this project, sometimes for educational purposes, sometimes for the tech improvements, although let's be honest, most of engine development is actually done for AAA studios in the form of their propietary solution.

## After all that, what is the purpose of HushEngine?
Well, that is something that is not entirely up to me, but really up to whatever fate decides, there's still a long way to go before we can hit a functional version, and let's not forget, I'm not the only one involved in this project (thankfully), my co-developer and friend Alan has a say in this as well; however, what I can tell you is my intention with this project, which is to learn more about the intricate systems that make our beloved games work, that's why I got into programming in the first place as I'm sure many of you can relate to, but now that I have a pretty good idea about how they work in the gameplay / backend side, I figured I'd move on to graphics, and, <b>OH BOY</b> there's defenitely a lot there. Plus I want to become a better low level developer and more importantly, a better software architect, <b>"games need to be fast, so their engines need to be even faster."</b> that's all I can think about whenever coding something for HushEngine, our aim is to create a fast and reliable solution for making games, not the overbloated <i>who-knows-how-many</i> GB piece of software that is Unreal, giving the game creators both development and runtime speed.

## Conclusion
We don't really aim to compete with the big engines out there, hell, we probably don't even aim to compete with the not so known engines out there, but we want to provide a product that both game devs and gamers can appreciate as one of its kind, giving them unparallel speed by pulling every trick out of the optimization hat we can think of. Granted, we might not have a built-in shader graph, tileset editor, Nanite or who knows what the latest fancy engine tech is, instead we'll have one promise, to not ever overcomplicate your development with internal systems that you'll have to learn on top of the basic technology upon which it's implemented.
